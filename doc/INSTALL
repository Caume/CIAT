 Cryptographic Implementations Analysis Toolkit - CIAT.
 (c) 2008 - Omar A. Herrera Reyna. Released unde GNU GPL v.3
 License. (See LEGAL.txt)


 Requirements: Compile and install the following libraries before
 compiling CIAT:

 - glut (a version of glut is included in Mesa3-D if you have it already. If
   not, get it from: http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)

 - fftw (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)

 - distorm64 (http://www.ragestorm.net/distorm/)

 - Mesa3-D (free, opengl compatible library, included in many modern
   Linux distributions. http://mesa3d.org/)

 - fxt (http://www.jjj.de/fxt/)

 Also, download and extract the cephes math library (http://www.moshier.net/
 #Cephes) in this directory: 'src/', and make sure that you have const.c, 
 gamma.c, igam.c, mtherr.c, isnan.c and polevl.c in a subdirectory named 
 'cephes/double/' within 'src/'. 

 After that simply type 'configure', 'make' and 'make install' (binaries 
 will be in /usr/local/bin). If you have trouble with the configure script
 try using the file 'Makefile.linux32'. It is a previous (more simple) version
 of the makefile (just replace 'Makefile' with it).
