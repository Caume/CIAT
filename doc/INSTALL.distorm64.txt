Installation of distorm64 library is not trivial. Enter the 'build'
directory and then enter the directory corresponding to the OS you have.

If you use 'make install' after 'make', only the dynamic version of the 
library (.so) will be copied.

Instead, just do a make under the directory of your OS and then:

1) Copy distorm.h to your local include directory (e.g. /usr/local/include)
2a) Copy distorm64.a static library to your local lib (e.g. /usr/local/lib)
   with the name 'libdistorm64.a'. You will find this static library at the 
   root directory of the distorm distribution after a successful 'make'.
2b) Alternatively, the dynamic library, libdistorm64.so to your local lib (
    e.g. /usr/local/lib) and run 'ldconfig'.
